# Bonzi.WORLD Revived+

This project is serious development. Things could change drastically throughout it's evolution.
<br>
Here be dragons!

### Running B.WR+
```
cd server
npm install
node index.js
```
After this, Bonzi.WORLD Revived+ will be accessible on port 3000. (http://localhost:3000/)
By default, the `server_mode` and `server_env` variables will be set to their development values. when you're ready to publish the server, remember to set these to production!
Additionally, you can configure the client's motd and version via json. The server version and channel can also be customized via the `settings.json` file.
